# pain-signal-nullifier


Abstract

Chronic pain can be due to unwanted action potential generation between the pain receptor and the spinal cord. These action potential signals are sent to the brain to process and interpret them as pain. Several methods have been established to nullify this pain such as the high frequency alternating current (HFAC), which creates a conduction block in the nerve so as to block the pain signals from passing. However, this method has several drawbacks including initial patient discomfort and reduced specificity of the conduction block. Another method that can be used to block the pain signals is called action potential annihilation. The goal of the project is to create an agent that searches the neurons that produce these pain signals, using appropriate search functions, and cancel them out, or annihilate them, in a computer-generated simulation with controlled variables. The model-based reflex agent that was created to perform these tasks was successful at blocking pain and reducing the side effects of stimulation under certain conditions. However, there were many drawbacks to this model, mainly due to over-simplifications of the model. Future iterations of this agent will likely have to incorporate more advanced techniques, such as searching and learning, in order to perform well for more complex models.
